# Getting Started with Pediatric Percentile Calculator
 
## 🌃 Features
This code is a calculator for pediatric percentiles, specifically for the weight-for-age, height-for-age, and weight-for-height percentiles. It takes in the child's sex, age (in months or years), height, and weight as inputs and returns the corresponding percentile values.
## 🪶 Notes
1. The calculator uses the WHO child growth standards to calculate the percentiles.
2. The age input can be in months or years, but it must be consistent (i.e. all months or all years).
3. The height and weight inputs must be in centimeters and kilograms, respectively (this feature may be updated in the future).
